##### Brute Force
Get all subset and check all for feability

1) Sort all jobs in decreasing order of profit.
2) Initialize the result sequence as first job in sorted jobs.
3) Do following for remaining n-1 jobs
4) If the current job can fit in the current result sequence without missing the deadline, add current job to the result. Else ignore the current job.
