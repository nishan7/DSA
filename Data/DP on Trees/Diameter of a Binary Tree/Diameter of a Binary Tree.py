Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. 
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. 
This path may or may not pass through the root.

We need to find height for every node's subtree (So, that is repetative job)
Sum of that height(left & right subtree) is the answer


**O(n)**

    if root == None:
        return 0

    left = diameter(root.left)
    right = diameter(root.right)

    temp = 1 + left + right

    ans = max(ans, temp)

    return 1 + max(left, right)   # We return heigh of tree

    def __init__(self,data=None):
        self.data = data
