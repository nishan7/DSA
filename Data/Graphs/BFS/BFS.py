#### Name:  BFS
Link: [link]()

Based on queues
It starts from top and move to level by level, it complete all the adjacent vertices, then next level

* Rule 1 − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Insert it in a queue.
* Rule 2 − If no adjacent vertex is found, remove the first vertex from the queue.
* Rule 3 − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the queue is empty.

> **TE: O(E+V)**  
*Same as DFS iterative but replace stack with queues*
