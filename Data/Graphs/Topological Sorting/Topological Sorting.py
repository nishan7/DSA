#### Name:  Topological Sorting
Link: [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/)

* The graph needs to be **DAG**(Directed Acyclic Graph)
* The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).
* Topological Sorting is not uniuqe
* examples: downloading dependencies before the actual package, by pip

- We first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices
- Push it into  stack (temporary stack)
-.Finally, print contents of stack
- **Note**: A vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack
